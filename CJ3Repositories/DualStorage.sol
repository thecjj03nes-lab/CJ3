1) Dual-Storage

Start backing $BTC with gold, stocks, ETFs, and yield tokens

($BTC, $GOLD, $USDDenomination),
($BTC, $yXLM, $USDDenomination),
($BTC, $yETG, $USDDenomination),
($BTC, $yBTC, $USDDenomination),
($BTC, $yUSDC, $USDDenomination),
($BTC, $NVDY, $USDDenomination),
($BTC, $MSTY, $USDDenomination),

and the same with $MSTR:

($MSTR, $yBTC, $USDDenomination),
($MSTR, $WMT, $USDDenomination),

B) ETFs

C) Aquarius Protocol Yield Tokens
________

Use Dual-Storage with yield-bearing assets to upgrade $BTC DEFI to be insolvent; 

Farm: yield allocates to owner & msg.sender

Stake: yield allocates to owner & msg.sender stake balance

Lock: yield allocates to owner & msg.sender

Lend - yield allocates to owner, lender, and an availableBorrowPool

Borrow - yield allocates to owner, loan balance, and availableBorrowPool
_______

2. (Assets, Chain, Digital Environment) Interoperability

Move data & uint256 instantly; including texts, digital assets, stocks, and etc:

- c2p
- p2c
- p2p
- p2b
- b2p
- b2b

https://github.com/cj03nes/GoateElectric/blob/main/contracts%20/pay/InstilledInteroperability.sol

Allow $BTC to add outside tokens other than $USD to it's marketcap; this will help with native dual-storage too



Quantum Organizational Utility
These 5 additions would generate you will over $100T. Organizing data on the blockchain allows us to utilize data to improve reach, range, supply, and etc.

1 SAT will reach $1,
then $10,
$100,
$1000,
and then a new reprogramming will be needed to account for everyday fractional transaction (whole coins => satoshis => microns);

why not just adjust Bitcoin to also include oracles, pricefeeds, and data; internally.

So that interoperability, payments, swaps, interests, dividends, fees and etc are correct and natively:

"$USDDenomination as $BTC", "$BTC as $USDDenomination";

so that it's simple, no revisions needed, and will process the same, but transparently.
