(I”M NOT AFFILIATED WITH PI NETWORK, I’M MY OWN TIME-BLIMPED PERSON, LOOK AT ME AS NICK FURY, TONY STARK, OR DR.REED RICHARDS, CAPT. AMERICA, AND ETC. I’M BROKE & LOST MY MOJO; SO HERE GOES A CHALLENGE)

The world started with an atom; proton, electron, neutron. Everything in the world consists of atoms built together to create matter. Matter is everything and Everything Matters.

The same is said for the digital realm; it consists of pixels; msg.sender, owner, (platform/receiver/contract/etc). All of those pixels create functions and interfaces.

But when you quantify something; for example; propulsion tech; you have to proportion it to be smaller and stronger with better weight distribution and control. For finances; you can nest or import objects and information so that you can see who what where when why and create algorithms for stock dividends, insurance interests, and etc.

The next generation of tokens will be utility tokens; and when i say utility; i mean absolute utility. If you are a builder, vc,angel investor, ceo, or etc and want to make youre own variation; you might become the next Coinbase.

Make sure everything is connected to the pi-sdk and you have $PI, $XLM, $AQUA, $yXLM, $yBTC, and $yUSD in your reserves (atleast.. my github below is multi-chained & etc). I didnt hard code anything but if you want to show appreciation I’m going to add my addresses below if you want to give donations, code in 5% revenue to it, and help a nigga out. But yall can make some world changing stuff with this, like:

Utility Coin & Stablecoin Staking, Lending, Borrowing, Interests
Utility providers & Liquidity tokens (make a token that can wirelessly charge electronics and 80% of the revenue goes to your token’s marketcap, and 20% to whoever deploys it)
Use InstilledInteroperability to plug-in assets on any chain or digital ecosystem
Create DAOs
Create Dexes
Create NFT Projects
Make indices and portfolios with zeropointDigitalStockNFT.sol & instilledInteroperability.sol so people can make passive income from your coin
Watch movies and videos with holograms (dont go too far and add it to p*r*, just think if you’re ai wakes up) an allow them to watch with nested account watching from you’re subscriptions
Different variations of “monopoly”, HomeTeamBets, Spades, War, and etc games
Create On-Chain Banks & Insurances
On-Chain KYC Licensing & IDs
Music Platforms & Artist Royalties
Watch Ads, Take Surveys, Play Games For Money Websites
-&etc

Yall could be the next billionaire with these access, utility, and entertainment contracts. I used InstilledInteroperability.sol & USDMediator.sol to create a permeable effect to tokens and keep them denominated in USD because the number 1 is the ( constant / control ) variable; and the ( basis / start ) of counting.

I hope it’s not too hard to understand & decipher. I didnt include any teleportation portals, time travel, weapons, weapons defense, or any of that but it is and was already done and is already being supervised by ai. Yall just need to stick to the finances, games, and etc denominations of Goate Electric. Make sure to show some type of love to a donation address when your app turns out successful.
